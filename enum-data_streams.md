Love this — I’m going to _think really hard_ and produce a thorough, practical enumeration of data streams, **organized by descending accessibility & usefulness**. For each stream I’ll give: a short description, suggested sampling cadence, derived features you’ll want, typical uses for music/progression, implementation notes, and a privacy flag. This will be the canonical checklist you can use to wire streams into the Tokenization/Analysis pipeline.

I’ll organize into **Tiers 1 → 5** (Tier 1 = easiest to get & most useful; Tier 5 = rare/experimental). After the list I’ll give a short prioritized implementation roadmap (what to add first in Phase 0/1) and compact JSON schema suggestions for a `DataPacket`.

# Tiers: quick meaning

- **Tier 1 — High accessibility, high utility**: Engine-provided, no extra hardware or permissions. Should be your Phase-0 core.
- **Tier 2 — Local-device sensors, opt-in**: Common on phones/modern devices / players may opt-in (mic, accel, watch via Bluetooth). High utility if available.
- **Tier 3 — External APIs / optional peripherals**: Weather APIs, fitness trackers requiring pairing, eye trackers (Tobii) — useful but require extra setup.
- **Tier 4 — Specialist hardware / research**: EEG, lab-grade GSR, implant telemetry — powerful but rare and sensitive.
- **Tier 5 — Derived / aggregate analytics**: session- or cross-session aggregates, community-level data — extremely useful but not immediate real-time inputs.

# Derived features & meta-signals you’ll always want to compute

(These are derived from the streams above and are essential inputs to tokenization/analysis.)

- **Speed_mean, speed_std, speed_peak_freq**
- **Acceleration & jerk metrics**
- **Angular velocity, curvature, straightness (net_disp / path_length)**
- **Occupancy grid / entropy / coverage_ratio**
- **Inputs_per_second, burstiness (Fano factor), n-gram sequences**
- **Near_miss_rate, time_since_last_miss, collision_count**
- **Beat-phase lock R (circular statistic of event phases vs beat)**
- **HR_mean, HR_std, HRV_proxy (RMSSD-like)**
- **Skin_cond_phasic_rate, tonic_level**
- **Ambient_rms, spectral_centroid, vocal_presence**
- **Enemy_pressure (aggregated nearby enemies × aggression)**
- **Session_motif_portfolio (motif_id → prevalence, stability)**

Standardize all derived features (documented) with normalization rules:

- Continuous → clamp and normalize to \[0,1] using scene-specific baselines and robust ranges (e.g., HR/HRV use biologically plausible ranges).
- Circular values (heading, beat_phase) → represent as sine/cos or angle in radians.
- Bins/quantiles for categorical predicates (low/med/high).

---

# Sampling guidance and buffers

- **Per-frame gameplay**: sample at game frame rate (30–144Hz). Compute windowed aggregates at W=1500ms, hop H=500ms by default.
- **Biometrics**: sample at device's native cadence; resample to 1–10Hz summary for fast thinking.
- **Audio/mic**: short-time windows (e.g., 1024 samples at 44.1kHz) for spectral features; aggregate to 10–30Hz descriptors.
- **Eye-tracking**: high cadence (60–300Hz) but for tokenization use fixation events or 10Hz binned summaries.

Keep ring buffers for last `N` seconds (configurable; e.g., 30s) for fast thinking and persist per-window features for slow thinking.

---

# Privacy & safety quick rules (must be in your spec)

- Default: **no IRL biometric data leaves the device**. Only derived motif IDs or anonymized aggregates may be exported with explicit consent.
- Strong consent flows for camera/mic/HR/GSR. Provide “local-only” mode.
- If storing per-user history, allow deletion and present concise opt-in explanations.
- Avoid storing raw audio/video; keep only features (RMS, centroid) unless user opts in.

---

# Prioritized Implementation Roadmap (Phase 0 → Phase 1)

**Phase 0 (minimum):** implement Tier 1 streams fully: player pos/vel, inputs, collisions, environment flags, enemy pressure, event logging. Add tokenization + MusicRouter mapping for footsteps, dodge, hit, ambient wind. Compute derived core features (speed_mean, near_miss_rate, occupancy entropy). Output score.json.

**Phase 1 (value bump):** add Tier 2 opt-in sensors: mic ambient (local only), basic HR via smartwatch stubs, accelerometer. Integrate into fast thinking modulation (velocity/tempo, pad intensity).

**Phase 2 (expansion):** integrate Tier 3 external services (weather API, eye-tracker SDK for research builds), start slow-learning with community detection and motif repo.

**Phase 3 (advanced):** Tier 4 specialist sensors for research mode only and robust privacy; deploy Phase 5 aggregate analytics for cross-player motif discovery if privacy-compliant.

  "meta": { "device_type": "pc" }
}
```

# Quick mapping cheat-sheet (how to convert streams → music tokens)

- **Position & step parity** → footsteps → PERC_KICK / PERC_SNARE (quantize to beat derived from speed).
- **Near-miss + dodge** → WHISTLE with pitch mapped to current scale; velocity ∝ HR spike.
- **Hit_taken** → ARPEGGIO token (3 notes) with pitch selection from motif chord.
- **Ambient mic RMS + env.wind** → PAD amplitude + spectral centroid → filter cutoff.
- **Enemy_pressure** → BASS_DRONE amplitude & cinematic swell build.
- **HR high + wolves_howl** → propose motif candidate; suggest related unlock (Courage orb).

## Enum

We’re going to overshoot: include way more than is strictly necessary, but that’s exactly the point. Later we can prune, cluster, and prioritize. For now, we want **density** and **imagination**, organized by **descending accessibility and usefulness**
