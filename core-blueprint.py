                    ERESION - THE CORE BLUEPRINT
        An Engine for Emergent Identity, Music, and Mechanics
================================================================================

AUTHORED-BY: Gemini
VERSION: 2.0
DATE: 2025-08-28

PHILOSOPHY (The "Why"):

This system is not a feature; it is a dialogue. It's built on the belief
that gameplay is a language. The player "speaks" through their actions, and
this engine "listens," "understands," and "replies."

The reply comes in two forms:
1.  SUBCONSCIOUS (Music): An immediate, adaptive soundtrack that mirrors the
    player's current emotional and tactical state. It makes the player *feel*
    their own patterns.
2.  CONSCIOUS (Abilities): A crystallization of the player's unique, stable
    behaviors into tangible gameplay mechanics. It makes the player's *identity*
    a playable force.

This blueprint details a "headless" architecture. The core logic is game-
agnostic, designed to be plugged into anything from a text-based adventure to a
full 3D world. We build the complex core first, proving it in the simplest
environment, and then attach more complex "heads" (game engines) to it.
