## Vision & Philosophy

### The One-Line Pitch
> **"A game that learns who you are through how you play, then gives you powers and music that could only be yours."**

### The Problem We're Solving

Traditional games offer the same experience to every player:
- Pre-composed soundtracks that ignore player behavior
- Skill trees designed by developers, not discovered by players  
- Progression systems that feel prescribed rather than personal

We're building something different: a game that observes, learns, and transforms alongside the player.

### Our Core Beliefs

#### 1. Nothing is Prescribed, Everything is Discovered
We don't tell players who they are - we help them discover it. Every ability, every musical theme, every progression path emerges from actual play patterns, not designer assumptions.

#### 2. Behavior is Language
Every action a player takes is a word in a language only they speak. Our system learns this language and speaks back through music and mechanics.

#### 3. The Game Has No Soundtrack - You ARE the Soundtrack
Music isn't composed then played over gameplay. It's generated in real-time from the patterns of play, creating a unique sonic fingerprint for each player.

#### 4. Progression is a Constellation, Not a Tree
Players don't climb a pre-made skill tree. They draw their own constellation of abilities through their behavioral patterns, creating progression paths that surprise even us.

### What Success Looks Like

When this system works, players will:
- Hear music that feels uncannily "them" - matching their rhythm, intensity, and style
- Unlock abilities that amplify how they naturally want to play
- Feel like the game understands them on a deeper level
- Never have the same experience twice, even on replay

## Core Concepts

### Tokens: The Atoms of Meaning

**Definition**: A token is a semantic unit representing a moment of gameplay. Everything becomes a token - footsteps, heartbeats, perfect dodges, moments of stillness.

```python
Token {
    timestamp_ms: when it happened
    domain: what type (game/music/biometric/environment)
    name: what happened
    intensity: how strong
    musical_role: what sound it could be
}
```

**Key Insight**: Tokens are neutral. A footstep isn't inherently a drum beat - it becomes one through context and pattern.

### The Temporal Graph: Living Memory

**Definition**: A multi-scale graph where nodes are tokens and edges represent relationships (co-occurrence, succession, inhibition). This graph IS the player's behavioral signature.

```
Micro Scale (10-100ms): Frame-perfect timing
Meso Scale (100-1000ms): Action sequences  
Macro Scale (1-30s): Strategic patterns
Session Scale (minutes): Evolution
```

**Key Insight**: The graph has volatile edges (session-specific) and stable edges (cross-session), creating both immediate responsiveness and long-term identity.

### Behavioral Motifs: Patterns with Potential

**Definition**: Stable patterns in the temporal graph that persist across time. These are the seeds of abilities.

```python
Motif {
    centroid: the "average" of this behavior
    variance: how much variation exists
    prevalence: how often it appears
    stability: how consistent across sessions
    core_tokens: what defines it
}
```

**Key Insight**: A motif must be stable enough to recognize but flexible enough to evolve with the player.

### Fast vs Slow Thinking

Inspired by Kahneman's dual-process theory:

- **FastThinking**: Immediate, reactive processing. Handles real-time tokenization, co-occurrence tracking, and instant musical response. Runs every frame.

- **SlowThinking**: Deliberate, analytical processing. Discovers patterns, mines motifs, generates abilities. Runs asynchronously during quiet moments.

## Module Documentation

### 1. Tokenizer Module

**Purpose**: Transform raw game data into semantic tokens that capture meaning, not just events.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Convert discrete events into tokens
- Sample continuous streams (velocity, position)
- Handle biometric data with privacy filters
- Enrich tokens with context

**Interface**:
```python
class TokenizerInterface:
    def tokenize_event(event: GameEvent) -> Token
    def tokenize_continuous(stream: DataStream) -> List[Token]
    def tokenize_biometric(bio_data: BioData) -> List[Token]
    def enrich_token(token: Token, context: GameContext) -> Token
```

**Design Decisions**:
- Tokens are immutable once created
- All biometric tokenization is opt-in with local processing
- Enrichment happens after creation to maintain separation of concerns

**Example Usage**:
```python
# Simple event tokenization
footstep_event = GameEvent(type="footstep", position=(10, 0, 5))
token = tokenizer.tokenize_event(footstep_event)
# Result: Token(timestamp=123456, domain="game", name="footstep", intensity=0.8)

# Continuous stream sampling
velocity_stream = player.get_velocity_stream()
movement_tokens = tokenizer.tokenize_continuous(velocity_stream)
# Result: Tokens created only at significant changes (acceleration, deceleration, turns)
```

### 2. Temporal Graph Module

**Purpose**: Maintain a living map of behavioral patterns across multiple time scales.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Track token co-occurrences and successions
- Maintain multi-scale edges (micro/meso/macro)
- Handle graph decay and reinforcement
- Persist stable patterns across sessions

**Interface**:
```python
class TemporalGraphInterface:
    def add_token(token: Token) -> None
    def get_active_patterns() -> List[Pattern]
    def detect_motifs() -> List[Motif]
    def save_core_graph(filepath: str) -> None
    def load_core_graph(filepath: str) -> None
```

**Design Decisions**:
- Single unified graph with scale-tagged edges rather than separate graphs
- Volatile edges decay quickly (λ=0.1) for responsiveness
- Core edges decay slowly (λ=0.01) for persistence
- Maximum graph size enforced through pruning

**Graph Structure**:
```python
Edge {
    nodes: (TokenType, TokenType)
    weight: float  # 0-1 strength
    scale_weights: {micro: 0.9, meso: 0.5, macro: 0.1}
    phase_offset_ms: int  # For rhythm detection
    last_observed: timestamp
}
```

### 3. Music Router Module

**Purpose**: Transform behavioral patterns into coherent musical expressions that always sound good.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Map tokens to musical roles (KICK, SNARE, PAD, WHISTLE, etc.)
- Enforce musical guardrails (scale locking, voice limits)
- Prevent dissonance while preserving emergence
- Adapt tempo and key to behavioral patterns

**Interface**:
```python
class MusicRouterInterface:
    def route_token_to_music(token: Token, context: MusicalContext) -> MusicalNote
    def apply_scale_lock(pitch: float, scale: Scale) -> int
    def manage_voices(new_note: Note, active: List[Note]) -> List[Note]
    def check_dissonance(pitches: List[int]) -> float
```

**Musical Guardrails**:
1. **Scale Locking**: All melodic tokens quantized to current scale
2. **Voice Limits**: Max 3 melodic, 5 percussive voices
3. **Dissonance Prevention**: Reduce velocity or retune harsh intervals
4. **Dynamic Range**: Automatic compression to prevent clipping

**Mapping Logic**:
```
Token Feature → Musical Role → Synthesis Type
Sudden + Low → KICK → Sine + Noise burst
Smooth + Rising → WHISTLE → Filtered saw
Rhythmic + Any → ARPEGGIO → Note sequence
```

### 4. FastThinking Module

**Purpose**: Real-time pattern recognition driving immediate musical response.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Maintain sliding windows of recent tokens
- Calculate co-occurrence matrices
- Predict upcoming tokens
- Drive real-time musical adaptation

**Interface**:
```python
class FastThinkingInterface:
    def observe_token(token: Token) -> None
    def calculate_cooccurrence() -> Dict[TokenPair, float]
    def get_active_patterns() -> List[Pattern]
    def predict_next_tokens() -> List[TokenPrediction]
```

**Performance Requirements**:
- Must process at game framerate (60Hz)
- Window updates in O(1) amortized time
- Pattern detection in O(n) where n = window size

### 5. SlowThinking Module

**Purpose**: Deep pattern analysis for motif discovery and ability generation.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Mine behavioral motifs from token history
- Cluster behavioral space
- Track pattern evolution
- Generate ability candidates

**Interface**:
```python
class SlowThinkingInterface:
    async def analyze_patterns(history: TokenHistory) -> List[Motif]
    async def cluster_behaviors(windows: List[Window]) -> List[Cluster]
    async def generate_abilities(motifs: List[Motif]) -> List[AbilitySketch]
```

**Processing Strategy**:
- Runs asynchronously during quiet moments
- Uses incremental clustering (DenStream) for efficiency
- Maintains stability scores across sessions

### 6. Ability Generator Module

**Purpose**: Transform stable behavioral patterns into unique, balanced abilities.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Generate abilities from motifs
- Ensure game balance
- Create evolutionary paths
- Generate visual/audio manifestations

**Interface**:
```python
class AbilityGeneratorInterface:
    def generate_from_motif(motif: Motif) -> AbilitySketch
    def balance_ability(ability: AbilitySketch) -> AbilitySketch
    def generate_evolution_path(ability: AbilitySketch, usage: UsageData) -> EvolutionPath
```

**Ability Structure**:
```python
AbilitySketch {
    trigger_condition: "perfect_dodge"
    effect_chain: [increase_speed, brief_invuln]
    resource_cost: {stamina: 20}
    evolution_axes: {timing_window: (100ms, 10ms), power: (1.0, 2.0)}
}
```

### 7. Game Loop Integration

**Purpose**: Orchestrate all modules in the main game update cycle.

**Responsibilities**:
- Poll input sources
- Route data through pipeline
- Manage module timing
- Handle state persistence

**Update Cycle**:
```python
def game_update():
    # Every frame (60Hz)
    events = collect_input()
    tokens = tokenizer.process(events)
    graph.update(tokens)
    patterns = fast_thinking.analyze()
    music = music_router.generate(patterns)
    sound_engine.play(music)
    
    # Periodically (1Hz)
    if should_analyze():
        await slow_thinking.analyze()
    
    # On pattern discovery
    if new_motif_found():
        ability = generate_ability(motif)
        present_to_player(ability)
```

## Quick Start for New Contributors

### For Engineers

#### Day 1: Understand the Flow
1. Read the Vision & Philosophy section
2. Run the minimal prototype (`python minimal_prototype.py`)
3. Trace a single event through the system:
   - Event occurs → Token created → Graph updated → Pattern detected → Music generated

#### Day 2: Pick a Module
1. Choose one module to deep dive (recommend starting with Tokenizer)
2. Read its documentation section thoroughly
3. Review the existing code and tests
4. Make a small improvement or add a test

#### Day 3: Contribute
1. Pick an unimplemented stub from the prototype
2. Implement it following the patterns you've learned
3. Add tests and documentation
4. Submit PR with clear description of changes

#### Key Files to Review First:
- `main.py` - System orchestration
- `tokenizer.py` - Data transformation
- `temporal_graph.py` - Pattern tracking
- `minimal_prototype.py` - Working example

### For Designers

#### Understanding Your Impact

Your design decisions directly influence:
1. **Token Definitions**: What events become meaningful
2. **Musical Mappings**: How behaviors sound
3. **Ability Templates**: What patterns become powers
4. **Progression Pacing**: When patterns crystallize

#### Key Questions to Consider:
- What behaviors do we want to reward/recognize?
- How quickly should patterns stabilize into abilities?
- What musical genres fit different playstyles?
- How do we balance emergence with game balance?

#### Contributing:
1. **Define New Token Types**: What events should we track?
2. **Create Ability Templates**: Design the effect chains
3. **Map Behaviors to Sounds**: Define musical roles
4. **Test Pattern Recognition**: Play and observe what emerges

## Design Patterns & Best Practices

### 1. Immutable Tokens
Once created, tokens never change. This ensures consistency across the pipeline.

```python
# Good
token = Token(timestamp=123, event="jump")
enriched = token.with_context(context)  # Returns new token

# Bad
token.event = "modified_jump"  # Tokens are immutable!
```

### 2. Async Pattern Mining
Heavy analysis always runs asynchronously to maintain framerate.

```python
# Good
async def mine_patterns():
    await analyze_complex_patterns()
    
# Bad
def update():
    mine_complex_patterns()  # Blocks main thread!
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation
When systems overload, degrade quality not functionality.

```python
if graph.edge_count > MAX_EDGES:
    graph.increase_pruning_threshold()  # Reduce detail
    # NOT: raise Exception("Graph too large!")
```

### 4. Privacy by Design
Biometric data is always opt-in, local-first, anonymized.

```python
if user_consent.biometric_enabled:
    hr_data = process_locally(raw_hr)
    token = create_anonymous_token(hr_data)
# Never: send_to_server(raw_hr)
```

### 5. Emergent, Not Random
Emergence comes from player behavior, not randomness.

```python
# Good: Ability emerges from observed pattern
ability = generate_from_behavioral_motif(stable_pattern)

# Bad: Random ability generation
ability = random.choice(ability_pool)
```

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Conceptual Questions

**Q: How is this different from adaptive music systems?**
A: Traditional adaptive music switches between pre-composed tracks. We generate music from behavioral atoms - every note emerges from how you play.

**Q: Won't all players end up with similar abilities?**
A: No! Even playing the same level, players exhibit vastly different micro-patterns. A cautious player and aggressive player will develop completely different abilities from the same encounters.

**Q: How do we prevent broken ability combinations?**
A: The balancing system has hard and soft caps. Abilities can be powerful but not game-breaking. Plus, since abilities emerge from actual play patterns, they tend to be self-balancing.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why Python for prototyping?**
A: Rapid iteration, excellent libraries for graph analysis and pattern detection. Production will be C++ for performance.

**Q: How do we handle graph memory growth?**
A: Three strategies: edge decay (old patterns fade), pruning (remove weak edges), and compression (merge similar nodes).

**Q: What if pattern detection is too slow?**
A: FastThinking handles immediate needs. SlowThinking runs async and can take its time. If still too slow, we reduce window size or increase clustering threshold.

### Common Issues

**Issue: Music sounds chaotic**
- Check voice limit enforcement
- Verify scale locking is enabled
- Ensure dissonance checking is working
- Reduce co-occurrence sensitivity

**Issue: No patterns emerging**
- Verify tokens are being generated
- Check graph decay rate (might be too high)
- Ensure window size is appropriate
- Look for events that should co-occur but don't

**Issue: Abilities generating too frequently**
- Increase stability threshold
- Require more sessions before crystallization
- Check if motifs are too generic

## Vision for the Future

This system is the beginning of something larger - games that truly understand their players. Imagine:

- Music that captures not just what you do, but how you feel while doing it
- Abilities that evolve with your skill, becoming more refined as you master them
- Multiplayer where players' musical themes blend and clash
- Games that remember you across sequels, carrying your behavioral signature forward

We're not just building a game system. We're creating a new language for games to understand and respond to human behavior. Every player becomes a composer, every session becomes a performance, and every game becomes uniquely yours.

*"The game doesn't have music. You ARE the music. The game doesn't have abilities. You BECOME the abilities. This isn't just personalization - it's emergence."*
