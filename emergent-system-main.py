                    EMERGENT MUSIC & ABILITY SYNTHESIS ENGINE
                    "Where Behavior Becomes Identity"
================================================================================

This system observes how you play, discovers patterns in your behavior, 
transforms those patterns into music that plays alongside you, and ultimately
crystallizes your playstyle into unique abilities that only you could have 
discovered.

Think of it as a mirror that doesn't just reflect, but amplifies and 
transforms. Your gameplay becomes a language, the system learns your dialect,
and then speaks back to you in music and mechanics.

PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION:
- Nothing is prescribed; everything is discovered
- Behavior is language, patterns are grammar, abilities are poetry
- The game doesn't have a soundtrack; YOU are the soundtrack
- Progression isn't a tree you climb; it's a constellation you draw

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Fast Path: Real-time tokenization → co-occurrence → immediate music
- Slow Path: Pattern mining → motif discovery → ability synthesis
- Feedback Loop: Abilities influence behavior → behavior creates music → 
                 music reveals patterns → patterns become abilities
